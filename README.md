Cube Ninja is a 3D web game inspired by the classic Fruit Ninja, but instead of fruits, you slice cubes ðŸŸ¦.
Cubes spawn randomly on the screen and fly upwards, and the player must cut them using the mouse or touch before they drop down.

The entire game is built with Three.js and runs directly in modern web browsers.

ðŸŽ® Gameplay: Classic Fruit Ninja mechanics, but with cubes instead of fruits.

ðŸ–± Controls: Use your mouse or touch input to slice cubes.

ðŸŽ¨ Graphics: Lightweight and minimal 3D visuals powered by Three.js.

âš¡ Logic: Each cube spawns randomly and follows a simple physics-like motion (flying up and falling down).


The project is mainly a practice for learning Three.js and exploring how to build fun, lightweight 3D games for the web.
